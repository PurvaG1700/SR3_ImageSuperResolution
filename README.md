# Image Super-Resolution via Iterative Refinement

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07636.pdf ) |  [Project](https://iterative-refinement.github.io/ )

## Brief

Code Submission for UCLA CS245: Big Data Analytics course offered in Fall 2023

This is an unofficial implementation of **Image Super-Resolution via Iterative Refinement(SR3)** by **PyTorch**.

**The other branches contain updated code for each specific experiments (zero_snr, splitImage, lazcos, bilinear_unet, and area-bicubic-upsampling-unet). This master branch only contains the unedited version of the unofficial code for the SR3 Paper (https://github.com/Janspiry/Image-Super-Resolution-via-Iterative-Refinement)**

Please refer to each branch for advancements to SR3
